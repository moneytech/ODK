ODK: The "One-Day Kernel"
=========================

The "one-day kernel" started as a "one-day" project on July 4, 2010, with the
goal if rekindling the joy of amateur OS development (first felt with
[speck](http://c1f.net/projects/speck/) and a few earlier kernels in
2000-2002). It lasted for a bit more than that one day, but subsequently
stagnated. In 2013, it might make a bit of a resurgence as a hobby project.
